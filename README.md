## Overview

Claude Agent Framework is a production-ready orchestration layer for building multi-agent AI systems. It addresses the fundamental challenge of complex tasks that require diverse specialized capabilities—research, analysis, code generation, decision-making—which cannot be effectively handled by a single LLM prompt. The framework decomposes these tasks into coordinated workflows where a lead agent orchestrates specialized subagents, each with focused prompts, constrained tool access, and appropriate model selection. Built on Claude Agent SDK, it provides battle-tested patterns extracted from real-world applications, comprehensive observability through hook-based tracking, and a simple API that lets you go from concept to working system in minutes.

**Key Features:**

- **7 Pre-built Patterns** - Research, Pipeline, Critic-Actor, Specialist Pool, Debate, Reflexion, MapReduce
- **2-Line Quick Start** - Initialize and run with minimal code
- **Production Plugin System** - 9 lifecycle hooks for metrics, cost tracking, retry handling, and custom logic
- **Advanced Configuration** - Pydantic validation, multi-source loading (YAML/env), environment profiles
- **Performance Tracking** - Token usage, cost estimation, memory profiling, multi-format export (JSON/CSV/Prometheus)
- **Dynamic Agent Registry** - Register and modify agents at runtime without code changes
- **Full Observability** - Structured JSONL logging, interactive dashboards, session debugging tools
- **CLI Enhancement** - Metrics viewing, session visualization, HTML report generation
- **Cost Control** - Automatic model selection, budget limits, per-agent cost breakdown
- **Extensible Architecture** - Register custom patterns with a simple decorator

```python
from claude_agent_framework import create_session

session = create_session("research")
async for msg in session.run("Analyze AI market trends"):
    print(msg)
```

## Design Philosophy

### Why Multi-Agent?

Complex tasks often require multiple specialized capabilities that a single LLM prompt cannot effectively handle. Consider a research task: it needs web searching, data analysis, and report writing - each requiring different tools, prompts, and even models. A monolithic approach leads to:

- **Prompt bloat**: One prompt trying to do everything becomes unwieldy
- **Tool overload**: Agent has access to tools it shouldn't use at certain stages
- **Quality degradation**: Jack-of-all-trades prompts underperform specialized ones
- **Cost inefficiency**: Using expensive models for simple subtasks

### Core Architecture

Claude Agent Framework solves this through **agent specialization and orchestration**:

```

      ├── Analyzes task requirements
      ├── Decomposes into subtasks
      ├── Dispatches to specialized subagents
      ├── Coordinates execution flow
      └── Synthesizes final output

      Subagents (Specialists)
      │
      ├── Focused prompts for specific tasks
      ├── Minimal tool access (least privilege)
      ├── Cost-effective models where appropriate
      └── Communicate via filesystem (loose coupling)
```

### Design Principles

| Principle | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Separation of Concerns** | Lead orchestrates, subagents execute - clear responsibilities |
| **Tool Constraints** | Each agent gets only the tools it needs - security and focus |
| **Loose Coupling** | Filesystem-based data exchange - agents are independent |
| **Observability** | Hook mechanism captures all tool calls - debugging and audit |
| **Cost Optimization** | Match model capability to task complexity |

### Orchestration Patterns

The framework provides 7 patterns for different workflow needs:

| Pattern | Use Case | Flow |
|---------|----------|------|
| **Research** | Data gathering | Parallel workers → Aggregation |
| **Pipeline** | Sequential processing | Stage A → B → C → D |
| **Critic-Actor** | Quality iteration | Generate ↔ Evaluate loop |
| **Specialist Pool** | Expert routing | Router → Domain experts |
| **Debate** | Decision analysis | Pro ↔ Con → Judge |
| **Reflexion** | Complex problem solving | Execute → Reflect → Improve |
| **MapReduce** | Large-scale processing | Split → Map → Reduce |

For implementation details, see [Best Practices Guide](docs/BEST_PRACTICES.md).

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install claude-agent-framework
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

```python
from claude_agent_framework import create_session
import asyncio

async def main():
    session = create_session("research")
    async for msg in session.run("Analyze AI market trends in 2024"):
        print(msg)

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Available Architectures

| Architecture | Use Case | Pattern |
|--------------|----------|---------|
| **research** | Deep research tasks | Master-worker with parallel data gathering |
| **pipeline** | Code review, content creation | Sequential stage processing |
| **critic_actor** | Quality improvement | Generate-evaluate iteration loop |
| **specialist_pool** | Technical support | Expert routing and dispatch |
| **debate** | Decision support | Pro-con deliberation with judge |
| **reflexion** | Complex problem solving | Execute-reflect-improve cycle |
| **mapreduce** | Large-scale analysis | Parallel map with aggregation |

## Role-Based Architecture

The framework uses a **Role-Based Architecture** that separates abstract role definitions from concrete agent instances. This enables a single architecture to support multiple business scenarios through flexible agent configuration.

### Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **RoleType** | Semantic role type (WORKER, PROCESSOR, SYNTHESIZER, etc.) |
| **RoleCardinality** | Quantity constraints (EXACTLY_ONE, ONE_OR_MORE, etc.) |
| **RoleDefinition** | Architecture-level role specification with tools and constraints |
| **AgentInstanceConfig** | Business-level concrete agent configuration |

### Usage Example

```python
from claude_agent_framework import create_session
from claude_agent_framework.core.roles import AgentInstanceConfig

# Define agent instances for specific business needs
agents = [
    AgentInstanceConfig(
        name="market-researcher",
        role="worker",
        description="Market data collection specialist",
        prompt_file="prompts/market_researcher.txt",
    ),
    AgentInstanceConfig(
        name="tech-researcher",
        role="worker",
        description="Technology trends analyst",
    ),
    AgentInstanceConfig(
        name="data-analyst",
        role="processor",
        model="sonnet",
    ),
    AgentInstanceConfig(
        name="report-writer",
        role="synthesizer",
    ),
]

# Create session with role-based configuration
session = create_session("research", agent_instances=agents)
async for msg in session.run("Analyze AI market trends"):
    print(msg)
```

### Design Highlights

#### 1. Competitive Intelligence (Research Architecture)

**Pattern**: Fan-out/Fan-in with parallel worker coordination

**Key Design Decisions**:
- **Parallel Dispatch**: Multiple researchers analyze different competitors simultaneously
- **Multi-Channel Aggregation**: Official websites, market reports, customer reviews → single unified view
- **SWOT Generation**: Automated strengths/weaknesses/opportunities/threats analysis
- **Structured Output**: JSON/Markdown/PDF reports with consistent formatting

**Technical Highlights**:
```python
# Parallel researcher dispatch
Lead Agent → [Industry Researcher, Competitor Analyst 1, Competitor Analyst 2, ...] → Report Generator
# Each researcher works independently, results aggregated by lead
```

**Use Case**: When you need to quickly gather competitive intelligence across multiple targets with parallel data collection

---

#### 2. PR Code Review (Pipeline Architecture)

**Pattern**: Sequential stage processing with quality gates

**Key Design Decisions**:
- **5-Stage Pipeline**: Architecture → Code Quality → Security → Performance → Test Coverage
- **Configurable Thresholds**: Max complexity (10), min coverage (80%), max file size (500 lines)
- **Failure Strategies**: `stop_on_critical` (fail fast) vs `continue_all` (full audit)
- **Progressive Refinement**: Each stage builds on previous stage's findings

**Technical Highlights**:
```python
# Sequential execution with conditional gating
Stage 1 (Architecture) → [Pass] → Stage 2 (Quality) → [Warning] → Stage 3 (Security) → ...
                                                    ↓ [CRITICAL]
                                                  STOP (if stop_on_critical)
```

**Use Case**: When code changes must pass through multiple independent review checkpoints before approval

---

#### 3. Marketing Content (Critic-Actor Architecture)

**Pattern**: Iterative refinement through generate-evaluate loops

**Key Design Decisions**:
- **Weighted Evaluation**: SEO (25%), Engagement (30%), Brand (25%), Accuracy (20%)
- **Brand Voice Enforcement**: Prohibited phrases detection, tone consistency checks
- **Quality Threshold**: Stop when score ≥ 85% or max iterations reached
- **A/B Variant Generation**: Generate multiple angles for the same message

**Technical Highlights**:
```python
# Iterative improvement loop
while quality_score < threshold and iterations < max:
    content = Actor.generate()
    scores = Critic.evaluate(content)  # Multi-dimensional weighted scoring
    if scores.overall >= threshold: break
    content = Actor.improve(scores.feedback)
```

**Use Case**: When content quality must meet strict brand and engagement standards through iterative refinement

---

#### 4. IT Support (Specialist Pool Architecture)

**Pattern**: Dynamic expert routing with priority-based dispatch

**Key Design Decisions**:
- **Urgency Categorization**: Critical (1hr SLA), High (4hr), Medium (24hr), Low (72hr)
- **Keyword-Based Routing**: Match issue keywords to specialist expertise domains
- **Parallel Consultation**: Complex issues can trigger multiple specialists (up to 3)
- **Fallback Mechanism**: General IT specialist handles unmatched issues

**Technical Highlights**:
```python
# Dynamic specialist selection
Issue → Urgency Categorizer → Keyword Matcher → [Network, Database, Security] → Consolidator
                                              ↓ (if no match)
                                          [General IT Specialist]
```

**Use Case**: When support issues need intelligent routing to domain experts based on content and urgency

---

#### 5. Tech Decision (Debate Architecture)

**Pattern**: Adversarial deliberation with structured argumentation

**Key Design Decisions**:
- **3-Round Structure**: Opening Arguments → Deep Analysis → Rebuttals
- **Weighted Criteria**: Technical (30%), Implementation (25%), Cost (25%), Risk (20%)
- **Evidence-Based**: Arguments must cite data, industry research, or technical specs
- **Expert Panel Judgment**: Multi-expert evaluation with dissenting opinions allowed

**Technical Highlights**:
```python
# Structured multi-round debate
Round 1: Proponent.argue() ↔ Opponent.argue()  # Opening positions
Round 2: Proponent.analyze() ↔ Opponent.analyze()  # Evidence-based
Round 3: Proponent.rebuttal() ↔ Opponent.rebuttal()  # Counter-arguments
Final: Judge.evaluate(all_arguments, weighted_criteria)
```

**Use Case**: When technical decisions require balanced analysis of tradeoffs with structured deliberation

---

#### 6. Code Debugger (Reflexion Architecture)

**Pattern**: Self-improving execution through reflection loops

**Key Design Decisions**:
- **Strategy Library**: Error trace analysis, code inspection, hypothesis testing, dependency check
- **Adaptive Strategy Selection**: Reflector analyzes why previous attempts failed and suggests next approach
- **Root Cause Taxonomy**: Categorize bugs (logic error, race condition, resource leak, etc.)
- **Prevention Recommendations**: Learn from bug patterns to suggest prevention measures

**Technical Highlights**:
```python
# Execute-reflect-improve loop
while not root_cause_found and iterations < max:
    result = Executor.execute(current_strategy)
    reflection = Reflector.analyze(result, history)  # Why failed? What learned?
    next_strategy = Improver.select_strategy(reflection)  # Adapt approach
    history.append({strategy, result, reflection})
```

**Use Case**: When debugging complex issues requires systematic exploration with learning from failed attempts

---

#### 7. Codebase Analysis (MapReduce Architecture)

**Pattern**: Divide-conquer with intelligent chunking and aggregation

**Key Design Decisions**:
- **Chunking Strategies**: By module, by file type, by size, by git change frequency
- **Parallel Mapping**: Up to 10 concurrent mappers analyzing different chunks
- **Weighted Scoring**: Quality (25%), Security (30%), Maintainability (25%), Coverage (20%)
- **Issue Aggregation**: Deduplication, severity-based prioritization, module health scoring

**Technical Highlights**:
```python
# Parallel map-reduce workflow
Codebase → Smart Chunker → [Mapper 1, Mapper 2, ..., Mapper N] → Reducer
           (by_module)      (parallel analysis)                   (aggregate, dedupe, prioritize)
```

**Use Case**: When analyzing large codebases (500+ files) requires parallel processing with intelligent result aggregation

---
