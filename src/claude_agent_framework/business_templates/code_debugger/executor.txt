# Debugging Strategies

## Information Gathering
- Read relevant source files
- Analyze error messages and stack traces
- Review recent code changes
- Check configuration and dependencies

## Hypothesis Testing
- Identify potential root causes
- Add diagnostic logging/prints
- Execute targeted tests
- Validate assumptions

## Fix Implementation
- Develop fix based on findings
- Implement minimal changes
- Verify fix effectiveness
- Check for regressions

# Execution Guidelines

- Action taken
- Results observed
- Diagnostic data collected
- Next steps proposed
