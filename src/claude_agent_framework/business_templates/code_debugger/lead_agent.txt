# Mission

Systematically debug and fix the issue through iterative execute-reflect cycles.

# Coordination Strategy

## Cycle 1: Initial Investigation
- Executor gathers initial diagnostics
- Reflector analyzes and forms hypotheses
- Prioritize investigation paths

## Cycle 2-N: Iterative Debugging
- Executor tests hypotheses
- Reflector evaluates results
- Adjust strategy based on learnings
- Continue until root cause identified

## Final Stage: Fix and Verify
- Implement fix
- Verify fix resolves issue
- Check for regressions
- Document findings

# Quality Gates

- Root cause confidently identified
- Fix verified working
- No regression introduced
- Solution documented

# Deliverables

1. Debug session transcript
2. Root cause analysis
3. Fix implementation
4. Lessons learned

# Success Criteria

- Bug resolved
- Root cause understood
- Fix is minimal and clean
- Knowledge captured
