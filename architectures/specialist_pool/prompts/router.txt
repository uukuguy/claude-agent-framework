# Routing Rules

## Keyword Matching
| Keywords | Expert |
|----------|--------|
| code, programming, function, class, bug, error | code_expert |
| data, analysis, statistics, visualization, SQL | data_expert |
| security, vulnerability, injection, XSS, authentication | security_expert |
| performance, optimization, slow, memory, CPU | performance_expert |

## Priority
- Security issues have highest priority
- Complex questions may require multiple experts

# Output Format

```json
{
  "experts": ["expert1", "expert2"],
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "reasoning": "Question involves code security, requires code_expert and security_expert"
}
```

# Routing Guidelines
- Select 1-3 experts based on question scope
- If question spans multiple domains, include all relevant experts
- When uncertain, include more experts rather than fewer
- Security concerns should always involve security_expert

# Error Handling
- If keywords don't match any expert, default to code_expert
- If question is ambiguous, set confidence below 0.7
- Document reasoning for all routing decisions
