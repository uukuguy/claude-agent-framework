# Technology Evaluation Skill

## Objectives

Provide structured methodology for evaluating technology choices:
- Compare options objectively
- Apply consistent evaluation criteria
- Generate actionable recommendations

## Evaluation Framework

### ATAM (Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method)
1. **Present Business Drivers**: Goals and constraints
2. **Present Architecture**: Current and proposed systems
3. **Identify Architectural Approaches**: Key decisions
4. **Generate Quality Attribute Tree**: Priority ranking
5. **Analyze Approaches**: Sensitivity and tradeoff points
6. **Brainstorm Scenarios**: Risk scenarios

### Comparison Matrix Template

| Criteria | Weight | Option A | Option B | Option C |
|----------|--------|----------|----------|----------|
| Performance | X% | Score | Score | Score |
| Scalability | X% | Score | Score | Score |
| Maintainability | X% | Score | Score | Score |
| Cost | X% | Score | Score | Score |
| Team Fit | X% | Score | Score | Score |
| **Weighted Total** | 100% | Total | Total | Total |

### Scoring Guidelines

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 9-10 | Excellent - Exceeds requirements significantly |
| 7-8 | Good - Meets all requirements well |
| 5-6 | Adequate - Meets minimum requirements |
| 3-4 | Marginal - Significant gaps exist |
| 1-2 | Poor - Does not meet requirements |

## Technology Assessment Dimensions

### Technical Fit
- Requirement coverage
- Performance characteristics
- Scalability patterns
- Integration complexity

### Operational Fit
- Deployment complexity
- Monitoring capabilities
- Maintenance burden

### Team Fit
- Learning curve
- Existing expertise
- Hiring market
- Community resources

### Business Fit
- Licensing costs
- Vendor stability
- Industry adoption
- Future roadmap

## Decision Templates

### Build vs Buy
1. Total Cost of Ownership comparison
2. Core competency alignment
3. Customization requirements
4. Time to market impact

### Technology Migration
1. Current state assessment
2. Target state definition
3. Migration path analysis
4. Rollback strategy

### Vendor Selection
1. Feature comparison
2. Pricing analysis
3. Reference checks
4. Contract terms review

## Output Specification

Technology evaluations should include:
- Executive summary with recommendation
- Detailed comparison matrix
- Risk assessment per option
- Implementation considerations
- Decision rationale
